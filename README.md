# Node.js with Datatables demo

I am using this project to learn node.js and how to build a development environment and bundle into a deployable package.  This package should have the following:

- Node JS is the server
- Datatables and Editor for CRUD operations
- JS based API for reading and writing to the DB
- Use of JSON Server for test data
- Sqlite and MySql DBs for production data
- Bootstrap for styling
